VAERS Data Analyzer for Windows
---------------------------------------


VAERS = Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a database of adverse events run by HHS.gov - U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

VAERS data analysis using publically available data at https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html

To use:
1) Download and install MySQL community database server with port=3306 (default) from https://mysql.com
2) Create db schema called e.g. "vaers", with user "vaersuser" having pw="vaers909".
3) Download VAERS data files from https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html, unzip locally.
4) Start the VAERS Analyzer, go to the Setup tab, connect to DB, create tables
5) Go to Extraction tab and load these files into the DB

VAERS data CSV and compressed (ZIP) files are available for download at https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html. 
For information about VAERS data, please view the pdfVAERS Data Use Guide at https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERSDataUseGuide_en_September2021.pdf

Created with Delphi 10.3, using MicroOLAP 3.3.1 direct access DB components.


Regarding VAERS data discrepancies
---------------------------------------

If you compare the results of the Analyzer with queries done at CDC Wonder, you may have noticed some discrepancies.

For 2022, data updated 28/1, the Wonder query reports a total of 291 death events when searching for year=2022 and event=Death.

But when extracting the 2022VAERSData.csv file, updated 28/1/2022, the extraction count shows 726 death events.
Thus the Analyzer death count is about 2.5 times the CDC Wonder query reports.

I have just added the ability to generate a visual inspection file when extracting data, so it is easy to confirm the existence of the true number of death events. 
A textfile is generated with original data truncated or expanded making all rows horizonally aligned, for easy visual confirmation by pattern recognition.

Double-checking this way, it is easily confirmed that the VAERS data file for january 2022, updated 28/1, indeed contains 726 death events.
Further analysis tells us that 702 of these are related to vax_type='COVID19', i.e. about 97%.

Added MySQL LOAD DATA using LOCAL INFILE, for very fast .csv file loading, around 20 times faster than regular queries, 
even though the files must be modified before loading.
But this demands that LOCAL INFILE is true for the server, and it requires SUPER privileges to set this global variable, if not editing the my.ini init file.

To add this to the ini.file, add the line LOCAL_INFILE=1 under the heading [mysqld] and restart the DB server.

Switched to MyISAM table storage engine for faster data loading, and corrected lacking date conversion in the previous pre-release.

13.02.2022
Added Injection Manufacturer listing, sorted by number of adverse event reports. This shows that covid-injections make up over 40% of all reports spanning 32 years.
